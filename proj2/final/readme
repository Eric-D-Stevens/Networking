SERVER: ser.c

  compiling: 
	o compile this code type "gcc -o ser ser.c"

  usage:
 	$ ser <SERVER_PORT>

  example:
	$ ser 5000

  to exit:
	exit with SIG_INT (^C)

  description: 
	when the above command is typed the server will wait on the port
	<SERVER_PORT> for a client to establish connection with it. at
	this point the server has nothing more to be done to it from the
	command prompt. all of the control is handed to the client.


CLIENT: cli.py

  compiling:
	no compiling will be done on this python program

  usage:

	To list a directory:
	$ python cli.py <SERVER_NAME> <SERVER_PORT> -l <DATA_PORT>     

	To retrieve a file:
	$ python cli.py <SERVER_NAME> <SERVER_PORT> -g <FILE_NAME> <DATA_PORT>     
        
  to exit:
	program exits after each command automatically 

  example:

	To list a directory:
	$ python cli.py flip2.engr.oregonstate.edu 5000 -l 2150     

	To retrieve a file:
	$ python cli.py localhost 5555 -g shorttext.txt 5556     

  description:
	when the above commands are entered the server must already be up and 
	running. the client program will run and communicate with the server 
	to achieve the desired command. there are two commands. the -l command
	will return a list of the servers current working directory. the -g
	command followed by a file name of a file in the servers current
	working direcory to the client and it will be saved in the clients 
	current working directory. if the file requested is one that already
	exists in the client working directory then the user will be asked if 
	they want to overwrite the pre existing file.
